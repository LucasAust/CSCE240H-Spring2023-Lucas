User: what is polio
Polio is a life-threatening disease caused by a virus. It was once one of the most feared diseases in the United States, but the creation of a vaccine in the 1950s ended the threat. 
The U.S. is now polio-free, though travelers can still bring it into this country.
Polio is short for "poliomyelitis." It iss a virus that spreads easily between people who are not vaccinated. 
In its most severe form, it can attack your spinal cord and brain and cause paralysis.
People of any age can get polio, but kids under 5 have the highest risk of getting it.

User: who is at risk
Polio is still a concern in some places. If you are not up to date with your polio vaccines, you are at risk of getting polio. 
If you are up to date on your polio vaccines but traveling to a polio-affected country, you may need a one-time polio adult booster. 
Check the travel health page of your destination and talk to your healthcare professional to learn what vaccines you may need before your trip.
