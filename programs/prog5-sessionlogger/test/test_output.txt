Input: What is polio?
Output: System: Polio is a life-threatening disease caused by a virus. It was once one of the most feared diseases in the United States, but the creation of a vaccine in the 1950s ended the threat. 
The U.S. is now polio-free, though travelers can still bring it into this country.
Polio is short for "poliomyelitis." It iss a virus that spreads easily between people who are not vaccinated. 
In its most severe form, it can attack your spinal cord and brain and cause paralysis.
People of any age can get polio, but kids under 5 have the highest risk of getting it.

Input: Who is at risk?
Output: System: Polio is still a concern in some places. If you are not up to date with your polio vaccines, you are at risk of getting polio.
If you are up to date on your polio vaccines but traveling to a polio-affected country, you may need a one-time polio adult booster.
Check the travel health page of your destination and talk to your healthcare professional to learn what vaccines you may need before your trip.

Input: What can travelers do to prevent polio?
Output: System: Get the polio vaccine
Make sure you are up to date on your polio vaccines. If you are up to date on your polio vaccines and traveling to a polio- affected country, you may need a one-time polio adult booster.
Check the travel health page of your destination and talk to your healthcare professional to learn which vaccines you may need before traveling.
Make sure children are vaccinated. For best protection, children should get four doses of polio vaccine. Ideally, children should receive a dose at ages
2 months;
4 months;
6 through 18 months; and
a booster dose at age 4 through 6 years.
For information about adults who may not have received sufficient vaccine protection, see the adult polio vaccination schedule.
See Polio Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) for more information.
Choose safer food and drinks while traveling
Follow the food and drink safety tips to avoid exposure to any food and drinks that could be contaminated by the stool of a person infected with polio.
Wash your hands often
Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after using the bathroom or changing a childs diaper and before eating or preparing food.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers do not kill poliovirus.
Do not touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. If you need to touch your face, make sure your hands are clean.
Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing.

Input: What should I do to prevent polio after travel?
Output: System: Sorry, I have no information on that question.

Input: Give me more information about polio
Output: System: Since 1988, the number of cases of polio in the world has gone down by 99%.
The U.S. has not had a case of polio since 1979. In 2018, sources reported only 33 cases worldwide.
But while many countries are polio-free, some still actively have it. And anyone who comes into contact with the virus who has not been vaccinated can get it.
The best way to get rid of polio for good across the world is to make sure people are immunized.

Input: What causes polio?
Output: System: You get polio from a virus. You have to come in direct contact with the virus to get it.
This can be person-to-person contact, or through contact with an object that has the virus on it.
When you have the virus, it lives in your throat and intestines.

Input: What are the types of Polio?
Output: System: Sorry, I have no information on that question.

Input: What are the symptoms of polio?
Output: System: Most people who catch the poliovirus do not have symptoms.
About 1 in 4 people will have symptoms that look a lot like the flu, such as:
Sore throat
Feeling tired
Upset stomach Fever Headache
Back or neck pain or stiffness Muscle weakness
Stomach pain Vomiting
"Nonparalytic polio" symptoms like these often do not cause you to become paralyzed. They usually go away on their own within 10 days.
A smaller number of people have a more severe kind of polio that iss called "paralytic polio."
If you have it, your symptoms will start off like the mild ones above. Within a week, you will also start to have:
A loss of reflexes
Severe muscle pain or weakness
Floppy limbs
A feeling of pins and needles in your legs
Paralyzed arms, legs, or both
Meningitis (an infection in your brain, spinal cord, or both)
Polio can be life-threatening if the muscles you use to breathe get so weak that they no longer work.
Years after you have polio, you may start to have other symptoms. Known as "post-polio syndrome," you could have:
Problems with breathing and swallowing
Muscle loss
Sleep disorders like sleep apnea
Trouble handling low temperatures
Polio is different from acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a rare but serious condition that also attacks the nervous system and causes your muscles to weaken.
Some people call AFM a "polio-like" illness, but it is not the same virus.

Input: When should I call a doctor about polio?
Output: System: Sorry, I have no information on that question.

Input: What is the polio diagnosis?
Output: Sorry, I have no information on that question.

Input: What is the treatment for polio?
Output: System: If you have polio, your doctor will focus on making sure that you are comfortable and try to prevent any other health issues.
Some treatments and tools for support include:
Pain relievers (like ibuprofen)
A ventilator (a device that helps you breathe)
Physical therapy that can help keep your muscles working
Bed rest and fluids for flu-like symptoms
Antispasmodic medications to relax muscles
Antibiotics     for urinary tract infections
A heating pad for muscle aches and spasms
Corrective braces
Pulmonary rehabilitation to help with lung complications
A mobility aid such as a cane, wheelchair, or electric scooter

Input: Tell me about the polio vaccine
Output: System: There are two types of the vaccine:
Inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV). You get this as a shot in either your leg or your arm.
Oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). This is an older form of the vaccine that is still used around the world.
Today, kids in the U.S. often get four doses of the IPV vaccine, one dose each at ages:
2 months
4 months
Between 6 and 18 months
Between 4 and 6 years
If you are an adult who got the polio vaccine as a child, you should still be immune.
The only reason you might need a booster shot is if you plan to travel to a country where polio is still common or you spend time with someone who has polio.
If you did not have all your vaccines or are unsure, your doctor can give them to you.
You will get two shots that are 4 to 8 weeks apart, and then a third shot 6 months to a year later.
While most of the world is also polio-free, three countries -- Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan -- have not fully stopped outbreaks of the virus.
Some people can have an allergic reaction to the vaccine. Usually you will see any symptoms of an allergy within a few minutes to a few hours after you get it.
To tell if you have an allergy to the polio vaccine, watch for:
A hard time breathing
Weakness
Hoarseness or wheezing
A rapid heart rate
Hives
Dizziness
Call your doctor right away if you have any of these signs.
