Input: What is polio?
Output: Polio is a life-threatening disease caused by a virus. It was once one of the most feared diseases in the United States, but the creation of a vaccine in the 1950s ended the threat. 
The U.S. is now polio-free, though travelers can still bring it into this country.
Polio is short for "poliomyelitis." It iss a virus that spreads easily between people who are not vaccinated. 
In its most severe form, it can attack your spinal cord and brain and cause paralysis.
People of any age can get polio, but kids under 5 have the highest risk of getting it.

Input: Who is at risk?
Output: Polio is still a concern in some places. If you are not up to date with your polio vaccines, you are at risk of getting polio.
If you are up to date on your polio vaccines but traveling to a polio-affected country, you may need a one-time polio adult booster.
Check the travel health page of your destination and talk to your healthcare professional to learn what vaccines you may need before your trip.

Input: What can Travelers do to prevent polio?
Output: Get the polio vaccine
Make sure you are up to date on your polio vaccines. If you are up to date on your polio vaccines and traveling to a polio- affected country, you may need a one-time polio adult booster.
Check the travel health page of your destination and talk to your healthcare professional to learn which vaccines you may need before traveling.
Make sure children are vaccinated. For best protection, children should get four doses of polio vaccine. Ideally, children should receive a dose at ages
2 months;
4 months;
6 through 18 months; and
a booster dose at age 4 through 6 years.
For information about adults who may not have received sufficient vaccine protection, see the adult polio vaccination schedule.
See Polio Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) for more information.
Choose safer food and drinks while traveling
Follow the food and drink safety tips to avoid exposure to any food and drinks that could be contaminated by the stool of a person infected with polio.
Wash your hands often
Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after using the bathroom or changing a child√¢??s diaper and before eating or preparing food.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers do not kill poliovirus.
Do not touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. If you need to touch your face, make sure your hands are clean.
Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing.

Input: What should I do to prevent polio after travel
Output: Sorry, I have no information on that question.

Input: More Information:
Output: Since 1988, the number of cases of polio in the world has gone down by 99%.
The U.S. has not had a case of polio since 1979. In 2018, sources reported only 33 cases worldwide.
But while many countries are polio-free, some still actively have it. And anyone who comes into contact with the virus who has not been vaccinated can get it.
The best way to get rid of polio for good across the world is to make sure people are immunized.
