Problem
For this assignment, I had to write a program that would take a disease from user input, read data from files about this inputted disease,
and answer specific questions about the disease and print it to the console.

 Solution
 I wrote two classes for this program. The main user interface class, and the disease class. I did this in order to focus on reusability.
 In the user interface class, I first greeted the user. Then I switched the method into one that would ask the user what disease they wanted to talk about.
 Based on this disease, I had the user add 2 text files that the program would read data from. The program then called a read file method for each of these files, 
 and returned the information in an arrayList. Based on these arrayLists and the disease name, I built the default disease by calling the constructor in the disease class.
 The disease class had characteristics for each of the 12 question types. I called the setters for each of these characteristics to sort the information. Each setter would loop through 
 each article until it found the information that was relevant to that characteristic and stored it in an arrayList. 
 This class contained a while loop that would keep asking the user for prompts until the user decided to quit. Each time the program would read the user input, and based on that input it would
 call the appropriate getter, and print out the information that it had. Once the user entered quit, the program would exit out.

Challenges
The main challenge I faced while writing this program was figuring out how to make it reusable. In my first program I did not have a disease class, but I knew I had to implement it this time around 
to be able to make reuse easy. I decided that making each question a characteristic of the disease would be the best way to expand this. Then Id only have to add characteristics if I needed to, and different 
diseases could be easily added.
